          visit the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies
          so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or

        <p>
          This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service operated

          USA. Google Analytics uses cookies. These are text files that are

          Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Section 6 (1)(f) GDPR.
          The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user
          behavior to optimize both its website and advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have activated the IP anonymization feature on our website. Your IP
          address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other
          parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to
          transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the
          full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.
          Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this
          website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on
          website activity, and to provide other services regarding website
          activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address
          transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be
          merged with any other data held by Google.

          originates from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party
          visitor data. The collected data cannot be attributed to any specific
          individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by
          adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid
          the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described above.
